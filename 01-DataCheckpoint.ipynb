    "## Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid integration of Generative AI into the global workforce has sparked an intense debate about which demographics are most vulnerable to job displacement. Unlike earlier waves of automation that primarily replaced manual labor, today’s AI systems generate text, code, and images, allowing them to perform cognitive tasks once associated with college-educated professionals. As adoption has accelerated since 2023, students and workers are questioning whether advanced degrees still provide protection or whether years of professional experience now offer a stronger defense. With 2030 projections approaching, it is no longer clear that a Master’s degree or even a PhD guarantees career stability, nor whether a decade of professional experience offers a stronger buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project specifically investigates whether a PhD provides a statistically significant reduction in AI-driven automation probability when compared to 10 years of professional experience. It also evaluates whether this potential shielding effect varies across technical and service sectors. By structuring the analysis around automation probability and AI exposure indices, we move beyond general discussion and instead test whether formal education or accumulated experience serves as a more reliable predictor of job security.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical foundation for this analysis comes from the task-based framework developed by Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo. Their framework argues that the impact of automation depends on the specific tasks within a job rather than the job title itself. Automation has a comparative advantage in tasks where machines can process information more efficiently, which explains why certain cognitive tasks are now highly exposed to AI. At the same time, technological change introduces new, complex tasks that favor non-routine cognitive skills, potentially creating a shielding effect for highly trained individuals. However, if AI primarily automates routine cognitive tasks that are heavily represented in technical professions, then advanced degrees may not provide the protection traditionally assumed. In service sectors, experience may matter more because these roles depend on social intelligence, tacit knowledge, and situational awareness, areas where AI remains comparatively limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical evidence reflects this tension. Tyna Eloundou et al. (2023) estimate that roughly 80 percent of the U.S. workforce could see at least 10 percent of their tasks affected by large language models, with higher exposure among workers holding advanced degrees due to the automaticity of writing and programming tasks. This challenges the assumption that more formal education linearly reduces risk. Conversely, research by Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey Raymond (2023) highlights complementarity effects, showing that AI can significantly boost productivity and act as a collaborator for experienced professionals rather than a substitute. The OECD’s 2023 Employment Outlook similarly identifies sectoral divergence, where AI substitutes for routine technical tasks but struggles to replace high-touch service work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although projections about 2030 remain inherently uncertain, this project moves beyond speculation by applying task-based modeling with O*NET data and Kaggle’s AI Impact on Jobs 2030 dataset to statistically test whether a PhD or ten years of experience provides a stronger buffer against automation risk, and whether that buffering effect depends on sector.\n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that a PhD will provide a greater reduction in automation risk than 10 years of professional experience within technical sectors. However, we expect the opposite pattern in service sectors, where accumulated experience will be more protective than formal education. \n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is grounded in the assumption that technical sectors reward specialized, high-level theoretical knowledge that may complement AI systems, while service sectors depend more heavily on practical judgment, tacit knowledge, and interpersonal skills that develop through experience and remain more difficult for AI to replicate. Therefore, we expect a sector-dependent shielding effect in which the relative value of education versus experience varies systematically across occupational contexts.\n"

    "**Education_Level**  \n",
    "Categorical variable showing the highest formal education required for the role. This represents the formal credential side of the model. I isolate the PhD category and compare its automation risk to other education levels to test whether the degree provides a measurable shielding effect.\n",
    "\n",

    "**AI_Exposure_Index**  \n",
    "Score measuring how integrated AI is into daily job tasks. High exposure does not automatically imply high automation risk. This variable helps distinguish augmentation from replacement.\n",

    "**ai_concept:** This variable identifies the specific field of AI research being measured. In this dataset, it is set to \"All AI research,\" which provides the broad context needed to measure a country's overall AI research intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Country/territory:** A standardized code (like ISO-3) used to identify the specific nation or region. This serves as the primary key for linking this macro-data with individual survey data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Country/territory_label:** The full name of the country or region (e.g., EU27, China, United States, India). It is used for categorization and comparing how the \"shielding effect\" of education differs across global markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**impact_level:** Categorizes the significance of the publications (e.g., \"All works\"). This helps filter the data to ensure the analysis is based on a consistent baseline of research quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pub_type:** Specifies the medium of the research, such as journal articles or conference papers (e.g., \"All publication types\"). This ensures the metric captures a comprehensive view of global academic output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**publications:** The core metric of the dataset, representing the percentage share of global AI research publications for that specific year and region. In your project, this acts as a control variable for regional AI maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**year:** The calendar year of the data point, ranging from 2000 to 2025. This allows for a longitudinal analysis of how AI research dominance shifted leading up to the 2030 automation risk projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptions of any shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project:** A shortcoming of the OECD.AI Publication Trends dataset is its focus on macro-level academic output, which lacks the granular, individual-level data on education and years of professional experience necessary for performing the core regression analysis. Additionally, there is a notable gap between academic research and industry application; because the dataset measures research volume rather than the actual commercial implementation of automation tools, it may lead to an overestimation of AI \"exposure\" in countries that are research-heavy but relatively slow to adopt new technologies. This discrepancy makes it difficult to use this data alone to gauge job security or the practical shielding effect of a PhD in a real-world corporate environment.\n"

    "### Using Two Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to use the Kaggle dataset as our main dataset. That’s where all our occupation-level variables are. It has job title, education level, years of experience, automation probability, and skill scores. All of our regression models will run on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OECD dataset is different. It works at the country-year level and measures AI research intensity. It doesn’t have occupation-level automation risk, so we can’t just merge it row-by-row. Instead, we’ll use it as a macro-level control.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we’ll clean both datasets. In Kaggle, we’ll standardize job titles and manually classify them into technical vs service sectors. In OECD, we’ll filter to recent years and calculate an average AI research intensity score for each country. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the Kaggle dataset includes a country variable, we’ll merge the OECD AI intensity score using country as the key. If it doesn’t, we’ll treat the OECD data as contextual support rather than a direct merge variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the final dataset will mostly be occupation-level data from Kaggle, with OECD acting as a macro-level AI maturity control when possible."

    "\n",
    "### Key Metrics & How We Read Them\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automation_Probability_2030 (0.00 to 1.00 probability)**  \n",
    "This is our main “risk” metric. Jobs scoring **0.00–0.30** are basically low risk — humans still run the show. **0.31–0.69** is medium risk, meaning AI is starting to handle some tasks. Anything above **0.70** is high risk, so that role could be fully automated by 2030.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AI_Exposure_Index (0.00 to 1.00 index)**  \n",
    "This measures how much a job interacts with AI day-to-day. **1.00** means AI is everywhere. Important: high exposure doesn’t automatically mean high risk. A PhD might be coding with AI all day but still be hard to replace because of the complex reasoning required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Years_Experience (discrete years)**  \n",
    "This is your standard professional tenure. For this project, we treat **10 years** as the “practical mastery” cutoff to compare against the PhD credential.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Skill_1 … Skill_10 (0.00 to 1.00 proficiency)**  \n",
    "1.00 is full mastery in whatever task that column is capturing. These are our controls — they let us test if the protective effect we see for PhDs is really about the degree or just because they have high underlying skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average_Salary (USD per year)**  \n",
    "Ranges roughly **$30k–$150k+**. Helps check if high-pay jobs are protected because of cost/value considerations rather than actual resistance to automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biggest Concerns & Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Synthetic Data:** The biggest risk here is that this dataset is simulated. If we see a “PhD shield,” it could just reflect the assumptions baked in by whoever made the data, not the real labor market.\n",
    "* **Abstract Skill Labels:** `Skill_1` through `Skill_10` don’t tell us *what* the skill is. We can see if a skill matters, but not which one. Makes Technical vs Service sector analysis more guesswork than fact.\n",
    "* **Sector Classification Bias:** There’s no Technical/Service label, so we have to classify jobs manually. How we decide what’s “technical” vs “service” can totally sway the results.\n",
    "* **Potential Multicollinearity:** In the real world, PhDs usually have fewer years of experience. If the data randomly assigns 20 years experience to a 25-year-old PhD, it breaks the real-life logic of our independent variables.\n",

    "Standardized country codes (like ISO-3). This acts as the primary key for linking macro-level AI research data with individual-level occupation data where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Country/territory_label**  \n",
    "Full country or region name (e.g., EU27, China, United States, India). This is useful for comparing how the “shielding effect” of education varies across different national contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **impact_level**  \n",
    "Categorizes the significance of the publications. Helps ensure we only consider data at a consistent baseline of research quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **pub_type**  \n",
    "Specifies the publication medium (journal, conference, etc.), so we capture global AI output comprehensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **publications**  \n",
    "The core metric: percentage share of global AI research publications for a country-year. In our project, it’s a **macro-level control** for regional AI maturity.\n",

    "* **year**  \n",
    "Calendar year of the data point (2000–2025). Lets us track longitudinal trends in national AI research leading up to the 2030 automation projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Concerns & Data Shortcomings\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Macro vs Micro:** This dataset is country-level, so it doesn’t have individual-level automation risk, education, or experience data. We can’t merge it row-by-row with the Kaggle dataset.\n",
    "* **Research vs Industry Gap:** Measures AI research output, not real adoption of AI in workplaces. Countries with heavy research output might not have high automation in practice, so using it as a control introduces uncertainty.\n",
    "* **Limited Observations:** Only 260 rows and 7 variables. Small sample size at the macro level may limit how finely we can control for AI exposure across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we’ll use this dataset as a contextual, country-level control to account for regional AI maturity, while all occupation-level regression analysis will still rely on the Kaggle dataset. This keeps the macro perspective without overstating its influence on individual automation risk."

    "## Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection and Bias\n",
    "Our team has carefully evaluated the potential for collection bias within the Kaggle \"AI Impact on Jobs 2030\" dataset. Because the risk scores are based on future projections, they are subject to the subjective judgment of the researchers and experts who originally labeled the data. This creates a risk of bias, where high-level formal education (like a Master's or PhD) may be viewed as more irreplaceable simply because the experts themselves possess those credentials. We will mitigate this by comparing these projections against historical trends of automation to see if the protective nature of education remains consistent across different data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proxy Discrimination and Social Impact\n",
    "A central ethical concern of this study is the risk of proxy discrimination. Formal education levels and years of professional experience are often highly correlated with socioeconomic status, race, and geographic access to resources. By investigating whether a PhD provides a \"statistically significant reduction\" in automation risk, we acknowledge that we are studying a variable that is not accessible to everyone. We must be careful not to frame our results in a way that suggests lower-educated workers are at fault for their automation risk, but rather highlight how systemic barriers to education may create a disadvantage in the future labor market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Honest Representation and Limitations\n",
    "To ensure the honest representation of our findings, our analysis will include measures of variance and uncertainty rather than just average risk scores. AI development is notoriously non-linear, as seen with the sudden emergence of Large Language Models, and a \"2030 projection\" is a snapshot of current expectations that could change rapidly. We will communicate these limitations clearly to prevent our model from being used as a definitive tool for high-stakes career or policy decisions. Our goal is to provide a reproducible and auditable analysis that contributes to the discussion on workforce transition without overstating the predictive power of our results.\n",

    "### Data Retention and Auditability\n",
    "In accordance with the project's lifecycle, we have established a data retention plan where all processed datasets and intermediate analysis files will be deleted upon the final grading of the project. To maintain auditability, we will document our entire methodology, from data cleaning to the final statistical tests, within our Jupyter Notebook. This ensures that our process is transparent and that any biases introduced during the wrangling phase can be identified and corrected by others in the research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biases / Privacy / Terms of Use\n",
    "**Are there any biases/privacy/terms of use issues with the data you proposed?**  \n",
    "The datasets we are using are publicly available and anonymized, so there are no direct privacy concerns. There is no personally identifiable information. We will follow all citation rules and terms of use for both the Kaggle and OECD data. The real issue to worry about is projection bias. The Kaggle dataset is based on expert-labeled automation risk scores, not real observed outcomes. That means those scores reflect assumptions about which jobs are replaceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes and how it was collected?**  \n",
    "Yes. Large labor datasets usually focus on formal occupations. Gig workers and people in unconventional paths are probably not fully represented. Education and experience are also highly correlated with socioeconomic status and access to opportunity. The differences between the datasets are probably indicative of systemic inequality instead of just pure skill differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will you detect these specific biases before, during, and after analysis?**  \n",
    "Before running models, we will check how education levels, sectors, and industries are distributed to see if certain groups are overrepresented or underrepresented. We will compare this to external labor statistics. During analysis, we will run subgroup regressions and test alternative model specifications to see if results are driven by specific groups. After analysis, we will report uncertainty measures and run sensitivity checks. If conclusions change under different assumptions, we will state that clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are there any other issues related to your topic, data, and/or analyses that are potentially problematic?**  \n",
    "Yes. Automation probability is a projection, not a guarantee of job loss. There is a risk that people interpret our findings as definitive career advice. There is also a risk of reinforcing narratives that lower education equals higher replaceability, which oversimplifies structural labor market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will you handle the issues you identified?**  \n",
    "We will clearly state that our results are probabilistic and based on projections. We will avoid deterministic language. Furthermore, we will frame our findings around structural trends rather than individual shortcomings. All data cleaning, modeling decisions, and limitations will be documented, so the analysis is transparent and reproducible.\n"
