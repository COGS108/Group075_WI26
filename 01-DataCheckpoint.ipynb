    "## Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid integration of Generative AI into the global workforce has sparked an intense debate about which demographics are most vulnerable to job displacement. Unlike earlier waves of automation that primarily replaced manual labor, today’s AI systems generate text, code, and images, allowing them to perform cognitive tasks once associated with college-educated professionals. As adoption has accelerated since 2023, students and workers are questioning whether advanced degrees still provide protection or whether years of professional experience now offer a stronger defense. With 2030 projections approaching, it is no longer clear that a Master’s degree or even a PhD guarantees career stability, nor whether a decade of professional experience offers a stronger buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project specifically investigates whether a PhD provides a statistically significant reduction in AI-driven automation probability when compared to 10 years of professional experience. It also evaluates whether this potential shielding effect varies across technical and service sectors. By structuring the analysis around automation probability and AI exposure indices, we move beyond general discussion and instead test whether formal education or accumulated experience serves as a more reliable predictor of job security.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical foundation for this analysis comes from the task-based framework developed by Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo. Their framework argues that the impact of automation depends on the specific tasks within a job rather than the job title itself. Automation has a comparative advantage in tasks where machines can process information more efficiently, which explains why certain cognitive tasks are now highly exposed to AI. At the same time, technological change introduces new, complex tasks that favor non-routine cognitive skills, potentially creating a shielding effect for highly trained individuals. However, if AI primarily automates routine cognitive tasks that are heavily represented in technical professions, then advanced degrees may not provide the protection traditionally assumed. In service sectors, experience may matter more because these roles depend on social intelligence, tacit knowledge, and situational awareness, areas where AI remains comparatively limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical evidence reflects this tension. Tyna Eloundou et al. (2023) estimate that roughly 80 percent of the U.S. workforce could see at least 10 percent of their tasks affected by large language models, with higher exposure among workers holding advanced degrees due to the automaticity of writing and programming tasks. This challenges the assumption that more formal education linearly reduces risk. Conversely, research by Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey Raymond (2023) highlights complementarity effects, showing that AI can significantly boost productivity and act as a collaborator for experienced professionals rather than a substitute. The OECD’s 2023 Employment Outlook similarly identifies sectoral divergence, where AI substitutes for routine technical tasks but struggles to replace high-touch service work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although projections about 2030 remain inherently uncertain, this project moves beyond speculation by applying task-based modeling with O*NET data and Kaggle’s AI Impact on Jobs 2030 dataset to statistically test whether a PhD or ten years of experience provides a stronger buffer against automation risk, and whether that buffering effect depends on sector.\n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that a PhD will provide a greater reduction in automation risk than 10 years of professional experience within technical sectors. However, we expect the opposite pattern in service sectors, where accumulated experience will be more protective than formal education. \n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is grounded in the assumption that technical sectors reward specialized, high-level theoretical knowledge that may complement AI systems, while service sectors depend more heavily on practical judgment, tacit knowledge, and interpersonal skills that develop through experience and remain more difficult for AI to replicate. Therefore, we expect a sector-dependent shielding effect in which the relative value of education versus experience varies systematically across occupational contexts.\n"

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
