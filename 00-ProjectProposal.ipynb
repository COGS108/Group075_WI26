     "Does a higher level of formal education (Master's/PhD) or years of professional experience provide a statistically significant reduction in AI automation risk across technical versus service job sectors?\n",

     "The rapid integration of Generative AI into the global workforce has sparked an intense debate regarding which demographics are most susceptible to job displacement. Historically, automation primarily replaced manual labor; however, modern AI is increasingly capable of performing cognitive tasks that previously required a college degree. This shift raises critical questions for students and professionals about whether advanced formal education or extensive professional experience serves as a more effective shield against automation.\n",
     "\n",
     "Existing research using the \"AI Exposure Index\" has found that roles requiring high levels of literacy and analytical writing—tasks often associated with Master's and PhD holders—actually possess some of the highest exposure scores. This suggests that high-level formal education may no longer guarantee career safety. In contrast, some data indicates that mid-to-late career professionals may benefit from \"complementarity,\" where AI functions as a tool that enhances productivity rather than replacing expert human labor.\n",
     "\n",
     "This project builds upon previous data science explorations found on platforms like Kaggle and GitHub that utilize occupational data to model AI impact. We will analyze these trends to see if the data supports the traditional view that education reduces risk, or if we are entering an era where practical experience provides a stronger defense in specific labor sectors.\n",

     "We hypothesize that a PhD will provide a greater reduction in automation risk than 10 years of experience in technical sectors, but experience will be more protective in service sectors. This is based on the idea that technical sectors may still value specialized, high-level theoretical knowledge, while service sectors rely more on practical, interpersonal, and experiential skills that are harder for AI to replicate."

     "### Ideal Dataset\n",
     "The ideal dataset would be a longitudinal panel study tracking individual career trajectories alongside AI adoption metrics. It would include variables such as Education Level, Years of Experience, AI Exposure Index, Job Sector, and Skill Profile. We would require at least 10,000 to 20,000 observations across diverse job titles to ensure sufficient statistical power for multi-linear regression. Ideally, this data would be collected via Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projections and task-based modeling from organizations like O*NET and stored in a tidy Relational Database or Parquet file.\n",
