    "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a type of technology that can create new content like text, code, and images. Unlike older forms of automation that mostly replaced manual labor, modern AI is designed to handle cognitive tasks that humans usually perform in professional offices. We are motivated to explore this topic because the speed of AI adoption has increased rapidly since 2023. This change has created a major debate about which workers are most at risk of losing their jobs. We want to determine if having an advanced degree, like a Master’s or PhD, still protects a worker from being replaced, or if having many years of professional experience is now a better defense.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this impact, this research utilizes the **Task-Based Framework** established by Acemoglu and Restrepo. This framework posits that to understand the impact of AI on the 2030 workforce, we must look at the specific responsibilities that constitute a job description rather than job titles alone. Automation holds a comparative advantage in tasks where machines can process information more efficiently than humans. This explains why some cognitive tasks, once reserved for college graduates, now show high AI exposure. However, AI also creates new complex tasks that humans are better at performing. The shielding effect for PhD holders suggests an ability to perform non-routine cognitive work. Furthermore, in service sectors, experience may matter more because those roles rely on social intelligence and situational awareness, which are areas where AI has not yet developed. This balance between displacement and reinstatement explains how different skill profiles affect worker stability. $^1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Research by Eloundou et al. (2023) indicates that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their tasks affected by Large Language Models (LLMs). Critically, their findings show that individuals with Bachelor’s, Master’s, and professional degrees face higher exposure to AI automation than those without, as tasks involving programming and writing are more easily replicated by generative tools. This challenges the long-standing assumption that formal education linearly reduces professional risk. $^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, a study by Brynjolfsson, Li, and Raymond (2023) provides a different perspective through the lens of complementarity. They found that while AI significantly boosted productivity for low-skill workers, it functioned as a collaborator for professionals in late-career stages, refining their expert output rather than replacing it. This suggests that professional experience may create a knowledge barrier that protects certain roles. $^3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the OECD’s 2023 Employment Outlook notes a sectoral divergence where AI may substitute for entry-level technical tasks but fails to replace the human premium in high-touch service roles. While these studies provide strong grounding, a potential threat to validity in this field is the speculative nature of 2030 projections; however, by utilizing task-based modeling from the O*NET database and Kaggle’s AI Impact dataset, this project moves beyond opinion to statistically test these competing theories. $^4$\n",

     "We hypothesize that a PhD will provide a greater reduction in automation risk than 10 years of experience in technical sectors, but experience will be more protective in service sectors. This is based on the idea that technical sectors may still value specialized, high-level theoretical knowledge, while service sectors rely more on practical, interpersonal, and experiential skills that are harder for AI to replicate."

    "The ideal dataset for this research would be a **longitudinal panel study** tracking individual career trajectories alongside AI adoption metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables:** Education Level, Years of experience, AI Exposure Index, Job Sector, Skill Profile.\n",
    "- **Observations:** At least 10,000 to 20,000 observations across diverse job titles to ensure statistical power for multi-linear regression.\n",
    "- **Collection:** Data would ideally be collected via a combination of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment projections and task-based modeling from organizations like O*NET, which breaks jobs down into specific, automatable tasks.\n",
    "- **Organization:** The data should be organized in a tidy Relational Database or a single CSV/Parquet file where each row represents a unique job title or individual profile.\n",

     "## Ethics \n",
     "\n",
     "### Data Collection and Bias\n",
     "Our team has carefully evaluated the potential for collection bias within the Kaggle \"AI Impact on Jobs 2030\" dataset. Because the risk scores are based on future projections, they are subject to the subjective judgment of the researchers and experts who originally labeled the data. This creates a risk of bias, where high-level formal education (like a Master's or PhD) may be viewed as more irreplaceable simply because the experts themselves possess those credentials. We will mitigate this by comparing these projections against historical trends of automation to see if the protective nature of education remains consistent across different data models.\n",
     "\n",
     "### Data Retention and Auditability\n",
     "In accordance with the project's lifecycle, we have established a data retention plan where all processed datasets and intermediate analysis files will be deleted upon the final grading of the project. To maintain auditability, we will document our entire methodology, from data cleaning to the final statistical tests, within our Jupyter Notebook. This ensures that our process is transparent and that any biases introduced during the wrangling phase can be identified and corrected by others in the research community.\n",
     "\n",
     "### Honest Representation and Limitations\n",
     "To ensure the honest representation of our findings, our analysis will include measures of variance and uncertainty rather than just average risk scores. AI development is notoriously non-linear, as seen with the sudden emergence of Large Language Models, and a \"2030 projection\" is a snapshot of current expectations that could change rapidly. We will communicate these limitations clearly to prevent our model from being used as a definitive tool for high-stakes career or policy decisions.\n",
     "\n",
     "### Proxy Discrimination and Social Impact\n",
     "A central ethical concern of this study is the risk of proxy discrimination. Formal education levels and years of professional experience are often highly correlated with socioeconomic status, race, and geographic access to resources. By investigating whether a PhD provides a \"statistically significant reduction\" in automation risk, we acknowledge that we are studying a variable that is not accessible to everyone. We must be careful not to frame our results in a way that suggests lower-educated workers are at fault for their automation risk, but rather highlight how systemic barriers to education may create a disadvantage in the future labor market."
