     [cite_start]"The rapid integration of Generative AI into the global workforce has sparked an intense debate regarding which demographics are most susceptible to job displacement[cite: 2]. [cite_start]Historically, automation primarily replaced manual labor; however, modern AI is increasingly capable of performing cognitive tasks that previously required a college degree[cite: 4]. [cite_start]This shift raises critical questions for students and professionals about whether advanced formal education or extensive professional experience serves as a more effective shield against automation[cite: 3, 5].\n",
     "\n",
     [cite_start]"Existing research using the \"AI Exposure Index\" has found that roles requiring high levels of literacy and analytical writing—tasks often associated with Master's and PhD holders—actually possess some of the highest exposure scores[cite: 7]. [cite_start]This suggests that high-level formal education may no longer guarantee career safety[cite: 5]. [cite_start]In contrast, some data indicates that mid-to-late career professionals may benefit from \"complementarity,\" where AI functions as a tool that enhances productivity rather than replacing expert human labor[cite: 8].\n",
     "\n",
     [cite_start]"This project builds upon previous data science explorations found on platforms like Kaggle and GitHub that utilize occupational data to model AI impact[cite: 6]. [cite_start]We will analyze these trends to see if the data supports the traditional view that education reduces risk, or if we are entering an era where practical experience provides a stronger defense in specific labor sectors[cite: 9].\n",

    "source": [
     [cite_start]"We hypothesize that a PhD will provide a greater reduction in automation risk than 10 years of experience in technical sectors, but experience will be more protective in service sectors[cite: 14]. This is based on the idea that technical sectors may still value specialized, high-level theoretical knowledge, while service sectors rely more on practical, interpersonal, and experiential skills that are harder for AI to replicate."

     "### Ideal Dataset\n",
     [cite_start]"The ideal dataset would be a longitudinal panel study tracking individual career trajectories alongside AI adoption metrics[cite: 16]. [cite_start]It would include variables such as Education Level, Years of Experience, AI Exposure Index, Job Sector, and Skill Profile[cite: 17]. [cite_start]We would require at least 10,000 to 20,000 observations across diverse job titles to ensure sufficient statistical power for multi-linear regression[cite: 18]. [cite_start]Ideally, this data would be collected via Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projections and task-based modeling from organizations like O*NET and stored in a tidy Relational Database or Parquet file[cite: 19, 20].\n",

     "### Real Datasets\n",
     "**1. AI Impact on Jobs 2030 (Kaggle)**\n",
     [cite_start]"- This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and designed for 2030 projections[cite: 21, 22]. [cite_start]It contains over 500 job roles with realistic projections based on economic trends[cite: 23]. [cite_start]Key variables include Job_Title, AI_Exposure_Index, Automation_Probability_2030, Education_Level, and Years_Experience[cite: 24].\n",
     "\n",
     "**2. OECD AI and Employment Surveys**\n",

[cite_start]While microdata may require academic requests, public CSV exports for the AI workforce are accessible[cite: 27]. [cite_start]Important variables include Industry_Sector, Skill_Demand_Intensity, Tertiary_Education_Share, and Automation_Risk_by_Occupation[cite: 28]."

     "## Ethics \n",
     "\n",
     "### A. Data Collection\n",
     [cite_start]" - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Our team has carefully evaluated the potential for collection bias within the Kaggle \"AI Impact on Jobs 2030\" dataset[cite: 31]. [cite_start]Because the risk scores are based on future projections, they are subject to the subjective judgment of the researchers and experts who originally labeled the data[cite: 32]. [cite_start]This creates a risk of bias, where high-level formal education (like a Master's or PhD) may be viewed as more irreplaceable simply because the experts themselves possess those credentials[cite: 33]. [cite_start]We will mitigate this by comparing these projections against historical trends of automation to see if the protective nature of education remains consistent across different data models[cite: 34].\n",
     "\n",
     "### B. Data Storage\n",
     [cite_start]" - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: In accordance with the project's lifecycle, we have established a data retention plan where all processed datasets and intermediate analysis files will be deleted upon the final grading of the project[cite: 46].\n",
     "\n",
     "### C. Analysis\n",
     [cite_start]" - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: To ensure the honest representation of our findings, our analysis will include measures of variance and uncertainty rather than just average risk scores[cite: 41]. [cite_start]AI development is notoriously non-linear, as seen with the sudden emergence of Large Language Models, and a \"2030 projection\" is a snapshot of current expectations that could change rapidly[cite: 42].\n",
     [cite_start]" - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: To maintain auditability, we will document our entire methodology, from data cleaning to the final statistical tests, within our Jupyter Notebook[cite: 47]. [cite_start]This ensures that our process is transparent and that any biases introduced during the wrangling phase can be identified and corrected by others in the research community[cite: 48].\n",
     "\n",
     "### D. Modeling\n",
     [cite_start]" - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: A central ethical concern of this study is the risk of proxy discrimination[cite: 36]. [cite_start]Formal education levels and years of professional experience are often highly correlated with socioeconomic status, race, and geographic access to resources[cite: 37]. [cite_start]By investigating whether a PhD provides a \"statistically significant reduction\" in automation risk, we acknowledge that we are studying a variable that is not accessible to everyone[cite: 38]. [cite_start]We must be careful not to frame our results in a way that suggests lower-educated workers are at fault for their automation risk, but rather highlight how systemic barriers to education may create a disadvantage in the future labor market[cite: 39].\n",
     [cite_start]" - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: We will communicate these limitations clearly to prevent our model from being used as a definitive tool for high-stakes career or policy decisions[cite: 43]. [cite_start]Our goal is to provide a reproducible and auditable analysis that contributes to the discussion on workforce transition without overstating the predictive power of our results[cite: 44]."
